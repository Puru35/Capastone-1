        "This capstone project is based off the \"Student Performance Data Set\" present in the Machine Learning Repository of the UCI archives. The Data Set contains features ranging from age and gender of the child, to his parents education and his previous marks. There are no missing values in this data set. As the file present on the website contains two csv files, one for mathematics, and one for portugese, I have taken the former as my training data set, and latter as my test data set. The Target attribute here \"G3\" which is the final marks obtained by the student.\n",

We will also try to find out the relation of the target with some of the various attributes given to us, hopefully from which we may derive some inisghts as to what affects a student's performance. "
